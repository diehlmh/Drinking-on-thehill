        <h1><em>Brunchin' Ain't Easy</em>: <strong>Volume 1</strong></h1>
        <p>
        What makes a good brunch? Is it the bottomless mimosas and bloody marys? Is it the recounting of embarrassing stories from the night before? Is it the fresh fruit? My answer..is all of the above. What each person looks for in a brunch varies, which is why it is important for the public to be educated on the intricacies of each brunch spot.<br><br>

Welcome to our first installment of Brunchin' ain't easy! Where we will be doing a weekly review of the brunch experience from a restaurant in Federal Hill. This week's restaurant is Don't Know Tavern, located at the corner of Light Street and Fort Ave. Without further ado, lets brunch about it!<br><br>

Walking through the doors of Don't Know Tavern was difficult. Not because I didn't want to be there, but because my mind was functioning at about 50-60% of its normal capability (thanks to the help of a man named Jack just a few hours before). With the guidance of a few good friends (there is power in numbers), I made my way into the establishment towards a table capable of holding our group of 6.<br><br>

If you have never been to Don't Know Tavern, the staff open up the windows facing the street which makes for a comforting breeze flowing through the building. The lighting with the windows open is just right, not bright enough where I have to wear my sunglasses (read: because of the hangover), but not dark enough to make every person in our group look like a zombie on The Walking Dead.<br><br>

We were quickly handed menus and the waitress asked for our drink orders. Now, you didn't have to have a degree in behavioral analysis from MIT to tell our group was hurting. Our waitress was quick to realize that and on her way to grab us waters. Upon scouring the menu, I decided on the 3 egg crab omelet (not a shocker to my friends who are reading this) loaded with crab dip, lump crab meat, and cheddar cheese with a side of breakfast potatoes. <br><br>

My highlight of the brunch was the drinks! Don't Know offers $10 All You Can Drink Mimosas and Bloody Marys. I repeat, $10! Words cannot describe how great that makes me feel. Best of all, you can switch between bloodys and mimos. I don't know about you guys, but all it takes is one good bloody to get me back to baseline and the sky is the limit from there. So I had my bloody and went right for the mimosas, as did the rest of the group. Our waitress realized we weren't messing around and was great with filling up our pitchers of mimosas. <br><br>

One key to a great brunch is the music. Does the restaurant go with the a softer, smoother jazz theme? Or do they throw in a plot twist and turn it into a dance party?<br><br>

Don't Know went with a mix of both. Get out your pen and paper to write this down. They went with the Billy Joel playlist on Pandora. To say it packed a punch would be an understatement. We were singing along to all the classics throughout the brunch. What a pick me up.<br><br>

While I was in the midst of hitting the high notes of Piano Man, our food arrived. This may have been the only setback of the whole experience. While I am a sucker for anything with crab in it, there was just a little too much crab dip for my liking. The crab dip to omelet ratio was leaning heavy on the crab dip side. I'm no Anthony Bourdain, so please head over to Don't Know and give the crab omelet a go!<br><br>

The atmosphere at Don't Know on a Saturday/Sunday can't be beat. TV's everywhere for your sporting event needs, GIANT Jenga, and (my personal favorite) Shuffleboard. You could literally spend all day there. But unfortunately, all good things must come to an end (read: bottomless brunch ends at 2 PM). So get there right at 10 AM!<br><br>

Thanks to Don't Know Tavern for a great brunch! Sorry to my liver for the unexpected day drink! Be sure to tune in next week for our next brunch review.<br><br>

        <h1>Drinking On The Hill’s Officially Unofficial Guide to the NFL Draft </h1>
        <h3>4/28/16</h3><br>
        <p>
          The 2016 NFL Draft begins tonight with the first round of picks starting at 8 PM. As per usual, the NFL has turned another event into an all day/weekend spectacle.

Although it can drag on, the elongated process allows for ample drinking time while watching college aged kids become instant millionaires (who can’t get behind something like that, amirite?).

Well I am here to help you successfully navigate your draft day experience with these 3 tips!<br><br>

1) <strong>Temper your expectations</strong>
If you’ve watched the draft before, you know you’re going to have to be in it for the long haul. Each team gets 10 minutes to pick in the first round. That doesn’t sound like too much time. WRONG. You have to assume that these teams have done their research, dotted all their I’s and crossed all their T’s, so that they would have a decent idea of who they wanted and who they were about to invest millions in. Wrong again. You are watching a live 3-ring circus. Have you ever seen the movie “Draft Day” with Kevin Costner? I’d like to think that is pretty close to what actually happens. Plus, K.C. makes literally any movie a best seller.<br><br>

2) <strong>Compare the draft to the Winter Holidays</strong>
The NFL draft is a lot like Christmas. The suspense of opening your presents (or in this case watching a large man who mostly likely didn’t attend 30-50% of his college classes, roam the gridiron on Sundays) is almost too much to handle. The spirit of the holidays (or the face paint you put on in the bathroom) beams through you. But then you have to interact with your relatives (watch rounds 2 through 7) and catch your yearly fix of second hand smoke while talking about your cousin’s new baby (who can barely contribute to the conversation) and your aunt’s new cat (read: 5th cat). The build up to the Holidays is great. The struggle bus you take to get through the Holidays isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Same goes for the NFL Draft. <br><br>

3) <strong>Select your friends wisely</strong>
The crowd that you surround yourself during the NFL draft can make or break your experience. You always need to have “that guy” who in their heart of hearts believes they could be the GM for an NFL team. They have enough breakdowns and analysis to make Mel Kiper’s hair turn grey (just laughed to myself, have you seen Kiper’s hair? Not possible). With this friend, nod and make loud noises like “mmph” and “mmhmm” in agreement. You stroke the ego, but you’re not pouring gasoline onto a fire.

You also need the friend that drinks to the point of intoxication where they provide their own “bold predictions” for each player drafted. For example. “That guy will be selling used cars by 2018!” or “He has a chance to be the next Jerry RIce!”. No one is ever going to be the next Jerry Rice. Used car salesman isn’t such a bold prediction (see: Sergio Kindle). This guy provides the entertainment when the “know it all” needs his mane turned down. <br><br>

There you have it! Your fool-proof guide to navigating the NFL draft. Take it all in and make sure you catch a good buzz. If you get to drunk, no big deal. Just remember, that shot of tequila kills less brain cells than a helmet to helmet hit (I’ve seen The Concussion Movie, I know things).<br><br>

Happy Drinking! ///<br><br>

    <h1>An Open Letter To Monday</h1>
        <h3>4/25/16</h3><br>
        <p>
          Dear Monday,<br><br>
          Please don't. I feel like we've had this conversation before and you continue to not listen. Time and time again, you have brought me down from my weekend ivory tower and reduced me to the corporate ladder peasant that I am.<br><br>

          Monday, you and I used to be so cordial in college. You didn't come with any "urgent" phone calls or passive aggressive emails. In college, I could "skip" you if I wanted to without any consequences, save for the evil eye from the professor on Wednesday.<br><br>

          My wallet is not too happy with you either. Do you think the $4 well whiskey & cokes at the local watering hole don't add up, Monday? The $5 guac/queso combo certainly isn't going to pay for itself!<br><br>

          What I'm trying to say is that I think it's time for a break. I need to really focus on me (read: Friday & Saturday) right now and I can't do that if I'm always trying to please you. Last Monday, I had to watch 3 SNL episodes on-demand to get over the day I had with you. Do you know how many commercials I had to sit through?! Commercials on demand, Monday? This isn't Communist Russia.<br><br>

          Please stop crying, Monday. It's a bad look for you.<br><br>

          Just let me catch a buzz in peace and I'll text you later or something...<br><br>

          Your on again-off again friend,<br>
          Matt<br><br>

        <h1>My First "Blog Pop"</h1>
        <h3>4/22/16</h3><br>
        <p>Hey Everyone! <br><br>
          Welcome to Drinking On The Hill. If you've found your way to this site your either one of my roommates or my mother.
          Mom, I'm begging you. Please stop visiting this page. I feel weird having to ask you 5 times.
         </p><br>
          <p>
            Anyways, this site is dedicated to the Happy Hour's of Federal Hill.
          Located in the heart of Baltimore, Maryland. This is my first post so I figured I would let you know what it is all about. From the daily specials drop-down menu, you can click
          any day of the week and find pretty much all the restaurants in Fed Hill and see what happy hour specials they have going on that day.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Having moved to Federal Hill last September, my friends and I were always struggling with knowing what places had which specials on which day. So I set out to create this site
          and "inform the masses" about what specials are going on when and where. Hope you enjoy all this handy information as much as I will (you'd think I would know the specials like the back of my hand?!). The goal of this blog is to provide some insight on each restaurant/bar
          and their respective specials. Additionally, being a part of the millenial generation, I'd like the blog incorporate bar/life experiences as I navigate the "emerging adultdhood" experience. Hopefully my writing and experiences can be relatable to you as well.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I have tried to get a complete list of every special each restaurant has, BUT in the case that I have failed miserably, please feel free to email me at drinkingonthehill@gmail.com and I will fix whatever issue there is ASAP.
          I've also created some social media accounts for this site, so I'll be posting stuff on there as well, like photos/videos from the whichever spot I choose to attempt to drink the work day away. So check those out when you have a chance
        </p><br>

        <p>
          So I'll nix the rambling for right now.<br>
          Thank you for stopping by! Happy Drinking!<br>
