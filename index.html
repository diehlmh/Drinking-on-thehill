        <h1>My First "Blog Pop"</h1>
        <h3>4/22/16</h3><br>
        <p>Hey Everyone! <br><br>
          Welcome to Drinking On The Hill. If you've found your way to this site your either one of my roommates or my mother.
          Mom, I'm begging you. Please stop visiting this page. I feel weird having to ask you 5 times.
         </p><br>
          <p>
            Anyways, this site is dedicated to the Happy Hour's of Federal Hill.
          Located in the heart of Baltimore, Maryland. This is my first post so I figured I would let you know what it is all about. From the daily specials drop-down menu, you can click
          any day of the week and find pretty much all the restaurants in Fed Hill and see what happy hour specials they have going on that day.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Having moved to Federal Hill last September, my friends and I were always struggling with knowing what places had which specials on which day. So I set out to create this site
          and "inform the masses" about what specials are going on when and where. Hope you enjoy all this handy information as much as I will (you'd think I would know the specials like the back of my hand?!). The goal of this blog is to provide some insight on each restaurant/bar
          and their respective specials. Additionally, being a part of the millenial generation, I'd like the blog incorporate bar/life experiences as I navigate the "emerging adultdhood" experience. Hopefully my writing and experiences can be relatable to you as well.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I have tried to get a complete list of every special each restaurant has, BUT in the case that I have failed miserably, please feel free to email me at drinkingonthehill@gmail.com and I will fix whatever issue there is ASAP.
          I've also created some social media accounts for this site, so I'll be posting stuff on there as well, like photos/videos from the whichever spot I choose to attempt to drink the work day away. So check those out when you have a chance
        </p><br>

        <p>
          So I'll nix the rambling for right now.<br>
          Thank you for stopping by! Happy Drinking!<br>
